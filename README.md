## Description

Need an app that will keep track of all your notes? Well look no further this project is an app that will take in user notes and store then to a db.json file that has persistant storage. Don't need a note anymore just go ahead and hit that delete key and watch it disappear.

This was a code refactor of given starter code. With the starter code I had to add server.js, helper folder, and write all the express.js to get the project working.
